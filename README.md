# SudokuGen
This program uses an implementation of Wave Function Collapse in order to generate a completed Sudoku puzzle.

Currently, this uses numpy v.1.24.2 and the built-in random package inPython.

TODO:
- [ ] Add an output csv file
- [ ] Have the program output a completed solution puzzle and one with empty cells for the user to complete
- [ ] Commandline inputs including amount of puzzles and amount of empty spaces
